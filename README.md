vimfox ALPHA
======

Live web development plugin for vim.


###what is vimfox?

Vimfox brings live css, javascript and html editing to vim. This means you
can edit a file in vim and directly see the result without having to refresh 
the page in the browser.

This is not my idea. A couple of days ago I was browsing on github and found 
[browser-connect](https://github.com/Bogdanp/browser-connect.vim), a vim-plugin
made by [Bogdanp](http://github.com/Bogdanp) which offers live reloading of css
files. 

I was curious about how the plugin worked and after reading up on websockets I 
decided to write my own plugin.


###installation

1. Install vimfox using pathogen / vundle or clone the repo directly into
your $HOME/.vim directory.

2. cd to the repo's root and:
        
    `$: ./sh install.sh`

   *This will download all the required modules using pip and install
   them locally in the vimfox-plugin directory. This ensures vimfox will
   work in virtualenvs.*


###how to use

Add this script to the (html) page you want to work on
```html
<script type='text/javascript' src="http://localhost:9000/vimfox/vimfox.js"></script>
```

####commands

```vim
" Start the vimfox server and make vimfox commands available to the buffer.
:VimfoxToggle

" Reload the buffer file without reloading the page in the browser.
:VimfoxReloadFile <force> <fname> <delay>

" Reload the page in the browser.
:VimfoxReloadBuffer <force> <delay>

" optional arguments:
" <force> boolean => Force reload the file.
" <fname> string  => By default vimfox uses the buffer's filename. Use this
"                    if the file on the server has a different name.
" <delay> float   => The delay in seconds the vimfox.js wil wait before reloading the file.
"                    You can use this if you need to compile a large less / coffee
"                    file to css / js.
```

####autocommands

Vimfox does not include any autocommands. This keeps the vimfox code clean
and the user in control.
You can add your own autocommands to the  ```g:vimfox_autocommands``` dictionary
where the key is the filetype and the value a list of autocommands.
Vimfox will automaticaly enable those autocommands for buffers where 
vimfox is enabled.

```vim
" autocommand examples

" first create the dictionary
let g:vimfox_autocommands = {}

" call VimfoxReloadPage after every coffee file write.
let g:vimfox_autocommands['coffee'] = [
  \ "autocmd BufWritePost <buffer> VimfoxReloadPage"
  \]

" call VimfoxReloadFile every time you leave insert mode in a less file.
" The filename argument makes sure vimfox reloads 'foo.css' instead of 
" (the on the server not available) 'foo.less'.
let g:vimfox_autocmmands['less'] = [
    \"autocmd InsertLeave <buffer> sil! w|call LessCSSCompress()|VimfoxReloadFile expand('%:r') . '.css',  1.5"
    \]

" for scss files. If you are 'watching' for file changes increase the delay to make
" sure vimfox reloads the new css file.
let vimfox_reload_fname = expand('%:t:r') . '.css'
let g:vimfox_autocommands['scss'] = [
    \'au! BufWritePost <buffer> VimfoxReloadFile "' . vimfox_reload_fname . '", 1, 0.25', 
    \'au! InsertLeave <buffer> :sil! w|VimfoxReloadFile "' . vimfox_reload_fname . '", 0.5'
    \]
```

####options

```vim
" host address vimfox server
g:vimfox_host = '127.0.0.1'
g:vimfox_port = 9000

" echo toggle state after VimfoxToggle
g:vimfox_echo_toggle_state = 1

" hide the vimfox status indicator
g:vimfox_hide_status = 0

" debug mode (for the vimfox server + vimfox debug messages to javascript console).
g:vimfox_debug = 0

" vimfox autocommands
g:vimfox_autocommands = {}
```
